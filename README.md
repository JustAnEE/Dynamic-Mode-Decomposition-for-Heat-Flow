# Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-for-Heat-Flow
This notebook uses dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to study heat evolution on a rod by using "known" (analytical) data of the temperature on every point at the rod at each time step. The notebook doesn't explain much about what the DMD algorithm is, or what it does. I've attached a PDF of my DMD notes for that.
